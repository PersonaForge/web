## ✅ Roleplay That Doesn't Fall Apart

**PersonaForge** is a full-stack framework built for **character consistency, multi-turn memory, and stylistic stability**.
By combining **LLM + RAG + Rule Engines + Post-Editing + Reranking + Feedback Loops**, it transforms your AI from a vague improviser into a **coherent persona you can trust**.

## 🧠 Why PersonaForge?

### 🎯 Ultra-Stable Character Identity

With Character Persona Training (CPT), we extract and maintain a compact, evolving profile for each role — ensuring consistent behavior across long conversations.

### 🔄 Robust Context Memory

Short-term recall + long-term learning using ChromaDB + RAG. The more it talks, the more it remembers — intelligently.

### 🧹 No Nonsense, Just Consistency

With our **Generate–Delete–Rewrite** pipeline, the system surgically removes off-brand output and rewrites it to align with core personality traits.

### 🪞 Self-Refining AI

Self-reflection meets ranking. With **Self-Refinement Loops** and **Ensemble Reranking**, AI learns to judge and improve its own responses in real-time.

### 🧭 Plan Before You Talk

Our **Plan-Then-Execute** strategy lets the model outline first, generate later — reducing hallucinations and improving logical flow.

### 🏢 Multi-Tenant Support

Built-in multi-tenant architecture with data isolation, tenant-specific configuration, usage tracking, and API key authentication.
